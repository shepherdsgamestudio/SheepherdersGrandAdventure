  storyText: Not one to give up easily (unless it's the middle of the night and sleep
    is calling), you decide to push on further, looking for clues. The unforgiving
    ground causes you stumble and nearly break your leg.  As you lie there, nursing
    your scratches and cursing the ground beneath you, your eye happens upon a tuft
    of white fur.  Following the path with your eye leads to additional tufts of white
    fur further along.  As you continue to gaze, wondering if you can even follow
    the trail, you hear the slightest bleating in the distance from where you came.
  availableOptions:
  - 1. Follow the white fur
  - 2. Follow the bleating
