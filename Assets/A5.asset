  storyText: ' The trail of white fur is tough to follow to your untrained eyes, but
    you slowly and surely make your way to the end of the trail.  You are astonished
    to find the gory remnants of a sheep stuck between two particularly large boulders.  The
    remains are covered in flies and other kinds of disgusting insects.  The view
    and smell of the deceased animal are so shocking that you don''t hear the scrabbling
    sounds behind you until it''s too late.  You turn around to see the form of a
    large bobcat in mid-air.  You let loose one last scream before the bobcat closes
    its jaw around your neck.'
