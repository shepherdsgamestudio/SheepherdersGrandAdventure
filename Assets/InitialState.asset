  storyText: You are Wendell Schaefer, a young sheepherder who has been watching over
    your family's flock for years.  For nights on end, you take up your post across
    the Venavian country-side on its western shores.  You and your brother Ulric take
    turns guard the flock through the endless nights.  The last few years has been
    quiet, not a single sheep of the flock has been lost.  Some (such as your father)
    may say that it was your diligent watch that kept the sheep safe.  That would
    be a lie.
