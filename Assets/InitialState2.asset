  storyText: Every night you wake up when Ulric shakes you awake, and promptly fall
    back asleep.  Only to waken at the first sunlight to find your flock precisely
    where you left them.  Today, however, was different.  As you came to your senses,
    the field was suspiciously quiet.  You stumbled out of your morning stupor to
    find that your flock is missing!
