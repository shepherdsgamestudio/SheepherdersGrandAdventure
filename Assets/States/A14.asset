  storyText: After what seems like an eternity of silence while following your brother,
    Ulric crests one of the many hills scatted around the landscape and pauses.  As
    you reach the top, you can make out the outline of the herd.  Your brother just
    turns to you with a look of disgust, shakes his head, and continues to walk toward
    the sheep.  There's no doubt that you'll be catching hell about this later from
    your father.
