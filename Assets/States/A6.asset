  storyText: Quickly giving up your search, you return back to camp to find your brother
    already stirring from sleep.  Ulric is not much of a morning person to begin with,
    usually greeting you with a series of grunts throughout his morning routine.  This
    morning is no different as he lumbers over to perform the glorious act of relieving
    himself on the closest boulder that he can find.
