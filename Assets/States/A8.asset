  storyText: 'With what seems like a a stroke of blind luck, the bleating continues
    to get louder as time goes on.  With a few minutes, you crest a hillside that
    opens up upon a miraculous view:  the herd in all of its glory.  With a deep sigh,
    you continue to the sheep and do a quick count.  Now, with any luck, you''ll be
    able to figure out this herding thing and get them headed back in the right direction. '
